  Move to the next unmortgaged property owned by another player; 
  If all opponents' properties are mortgaged, do nothing

Rolling the Bus lets you choose your move: 
  Go the distance of one of the dice, or go the combined distance
  e.g. If roll 5 & 2, can choose to move 5 spaces, 2 spaces, or 7 spaces

IDEAS:

- Money = Doubloons
- Below player name and funds: small, semi-transparent squares representing each property
  that are filled in when player owns said property
- Properties on board show small icons to indicate owner
- Animated dice roll
- Allow players to choose who starts or have game randomly select
